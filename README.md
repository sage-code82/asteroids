# Asteroids Game using JavaScript, HTML5 and Canvas

## How it all works

## Stretch Goals

Stretch Goals I would like to try and do :

Give the player the option to move around.

A change of weapon - when a certain score is reached weapon changes.

Add in sound effects

Add in music for the game, music alsom speeds up as the game goes on to add to anxiety!
