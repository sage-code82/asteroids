ITS WORKING! For now just a quick game but the building blocks for me to add to it as the year goes on.

## Stretch Goals

Stretch Goals I would like to try and do :

Give the player the option to move around.

A change of weapon - when a certain score is reached

Levels - speed increase of enemies, shapes change.

Add in sound effects

Add in music for the game, music alsom speeds up as the game goes on to add to anxiety!

Leaderboard

Different shapes and colors act differently
